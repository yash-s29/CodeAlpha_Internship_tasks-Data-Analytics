# CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship

This repository contains the comprehensive projects and documentation completed during my Data Analytics Internship at CodeAlpha. The curriculum covers the entire data pipeline—from automated collection and cleaning to advanced visualization and sentiment modeling.

# 📂 Project Structure

# 🕸️ Task 1: Advanced Web Scraping

- Objective: Bridge the gap between unstructured web data and structured analysis by creating custom datasets.

- Methodology: * Automated Extraction: Leveraged Octoparse 8.0 to build crawlers for complex websites with AJAX and pagination, bypassing manual coding for large-scale data harvesting.

- Programmatic Scraping: Developed Python scripts using BeautifulSoup and Scrapy to parse HTML DOM trees and handle web navigation.

- Key Skills: Data mining, HTML structure analysis, handling CSS selectors, and data export (CSV/JSON).

# 🔍 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Objective: Uncover the "hidden story" within datasets through statistical rigor.

- Process:

// Data Auditing: Inspected data types, handled null values, and treated outliers.

// Statistical Profiling: Calculated measures of central tendency and dispersion.

// Hypothesis Testing: Validated assumptions about variables using correlation matrices and distribution plots.

- Insights: Identified critical trends and anomalies that inform business intelligence.

# 📈 Task 3: Data Visualization

- Objective: Transform raw numbers into intuitive, high-fidelity visual assets.

- Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tableau.

- Strategy: * Designed multivariate charts to reveal complex relationships.

- Focused on Data Storytelling: selecting the right chart type (e.g., Heatmaps for correlation, Boxplots for variance) to drive decision-making.

- Deliverable: A suite of polished, professional-grade dashboards.

# 🎭 Task 4: Sentiment Analysis (NLP)

- Objective: Quantify public perception and emotional tone from textual data.

- Workflow:

// Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, lemmatization, and noise reduction (Stop-word removal).

// Sentiment Modeling: Classified text into Positive, Negative, or Neutral using NLP lexicons and emotional detection algorithms.

- Application: Analyzed sources like Amazon reviews or social media to derive actionable brand insights.

# 🛠️ Technical Toolkit

- Data Collection: "Octoparse 8.0, BeautifulSoup4, Scrapy"
- Data Manipulation: "Pandas, NumPy"
- Data Visualization: "Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly"
- Natural Language Processing: "NLTK, TextBlob, VADER"
- Environment: "Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code, Git"

# 🚀 Installation & Usage
- Clone the Repository:

// git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/CodeAlpha_Data_Analytics.git

- Setup Environment:

// pip install -r requirements.txt

- Execution: Explore the individual task folders (e.g., /Task-01-Web-Scraping) and run the Jupyter notebooks to see the analysis in real-time.

# 📌 Internship Highlights

- Custom Dataset Creation: Successfully built 3+ unique datasets from the web.

- Insight-Driven: Not just code—focused on the why behind the data.

- Portfolio Ready: All visualizations are designed with a focus on UI/UX for data reports.
